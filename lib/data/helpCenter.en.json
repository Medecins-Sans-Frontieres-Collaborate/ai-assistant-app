    {
      "question": "What is the MSF AI Assistant?",
      "answer": "The MSF AI Assistant is a custom-built internal AI chat tool for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff. This solution enhances privacy by keeping conversation data within MSF systems, offering a secure alternative to external services. It supports multiple AI models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, o1, DeepSeek, Llama, Grok) and features like web search, voice transcription with translation, and customizable prompts and tones. The AI Assistant can help with answering questions, generating content, translating text, brainstorming ideas, and more. It's designed as an assistant to your work - always check its output for quality and accuracy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What models are available?",
      "answer": "The MSF AI Assistant provides access to multiple AI models:\n- GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI)\n- o1, o1-mini (OpenAI reasoning models)\n- DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek)\n- Llama 3.3 70B, Llama 3.1 405B (Meta)\n- Grok-2 (xAI)\n\nYou can switch models anytime using the model selector dropdown at the top of the chat."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Quick Actions (Prompts & Tones)?",
      "answer": "Quick Actions let you quickly apply prompts and tones to your messages:\n\n• Prompts: Reusable templates for common tasks (e.g., 'Translate to French', 'Summarize this document'). Create custom prompts or use the built-in AI assistant to generate them.\n\n• Tones: Adjust how the AI responds (e.g., Professional, Casual, Technical). Apply tones to make responses match your needs.\n\nAccess Quick Actions via the lightning bolt icon (⚡) in the chat input or press / to search."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Search Mode?",
      "answer": "Search Mode enables web search when the AI needs current information. There are two options:\n\n• Privacy-Focused Mode (default): Only sends search queries to Azure AI Foundry, not your full conversation. More private but slower.\n\n• Azure AI Foundry Mode (GPT-4.1 only): Stores your full conversation in Azure AI Foundry for faster responses with direct web search access.\n\nLearn more about the privacy differences in Settings > Models > Search Routing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I use voice transcription?",
      "answer": "Click the microphone icon in the chat input to start recording. The AI will transcribe your speech to text. After transcription, you can:\n- Copy the text\n- Download as a file\n- Translate to 13+ languages (Arabic, Bengali, English, French, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Ukrainian, Urdu, and more)\n\nThis feature is great for meeting notes, interviews, or quick voice input."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the MSF AI Assistant on my phone?",
      "answer": "Yes! The MSF AI Assistant works as a Progressive Web App (PWA). On mobile:\n1. Open ai.msf.org in your browser and sign in\n2. Navigate to Settings > Mobile App for detailed instructions\n3. Tap 'Add to Home Screen' (iOS Safari) or 'Install' (Android Chrome)\n4. The app will work like a native app with offline support and faster loading\n\nImportant: Install after signing in to preserve your authentication. You can also install it on desktop browsers for a better experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where is my conversation data stored?",
      "answer": "Your conversation history is stored locally in your browser's storage, not on any server. This means:\n- Your chats only exist on your device\n- They won't sync across devices or browsers\n- Clearing browser data will delete your conversations\n\nIf using Azure AI Foundry Mode for search, only those conversations are also stored in Azure AI Foundry with a thread ID. See Settings > Models for more details."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Custom Agents?",
      "answer": "Custom Agents are advanced AI configurations that run on the MSF AI Assistant Foundry instance with specialized capabilities. They can use tools like web search and code interpretation automatically. This is an advanced feature requiring coordination with the AI Assistant technical team to create agent IDs. Find them in Settings > Models > Agents tab."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I trust the AI's responses 100%?",
      "answer": "No. While the MSF AI Assistant is a powerful tool, it should not replace human judgment and expertise. Always:\n- Verify factual information\n- Check for bias and accuracy\n- Review outputs before using them in official work\n- Do not enter personal data or highly sensitive information\n\nThe AI is an assistant, not a decision-maker."
    },
    {
      "question": "What data should I NOT put into the AI Assistant?",
      "answer": "Do not enter:\n- Personal data (names, phone numbers, email addresses, CVs)\n- Highly sensitive operational details\n- Patient information or medical records\n- Anything that could identify individuals or compromise safety\n\nSee the Privacy Policy in the Help Center for complete guidelines."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I export or clear my data?",
      "answer": "In Settings > Data Management, you can:\n- Export all conversations and prompts as JSON\n- Clear all conversations\n- Import previously exported data\n- Check storage usage\n\nExported data can be imported later or moved to another browser."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where should I go with questions or feedback?",
      "answer": "Contact support:\n- US users: ai@newyork.msf.org\n- Non-US users: ai.team@amsterdam.msf.org\n\nYou can also access the Help Center anytime from Settings > Help & Support."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can I learn more about the AI Assistant project?",
      "answer": "Visit the AI Accelerator portal on Pamoja for project documentation, updates, and resources:\nhttps://msfintl.sharepoint.com/sites/PamojaPortal_AIAccelerator\n\nThis portal includes information about the project roadmap, training materials, and ways to get involved."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the MSF AI Assistant open source?",
      "answer": "Yes! The MSF AI Assistant is open source and available on GitHub. You can view the codebase, contribute improvements, or learn from the implementation:\nhttps://github.com/Medecins-Sans-Frontieres-Collaborate/ai-assistant-app\n\nThe project is built with Next.js, React, and integrates with multiple AI providers. Contributions and feedback are welcome!"
